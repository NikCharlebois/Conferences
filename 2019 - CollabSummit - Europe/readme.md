  <h2>Session Abstract</h2>
<p>SharePointDSC allows organization to automate the deployment of their SharePoint farms, and ensure a continuous monitoring of configuration drifts. With ReverseDSC, enterprises can extract full fidelity PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) scripts from their existing 2013/2016 environment and use it to replicate their environments as a SharePoint 2019 one within a few clicks. In this session we will migrate an existing SharePoint 2013 environment onto SharePoint 2019 using PowerShell DSC.</p>
